The CIA triad is used in [[cybersecurity]]. It defines three goals that a system should achieve:
- Confidentiality
	- Data confidentiality - Ensures that private or confidential information is not made available to unauthorised individuals
	- Privacy - Ensures individuals can control what information related to them is collected and stored by the system, as well as who has access to that information
- Integrity
	- Data integrity - Ensures information and programs are only altered by authorised individuals
	- System integrity - Ensures that a system performs its function unimpaired by unauthorised manipulation
- Availability
	- Availability - Ensures the system works promptly and service is not denied to authorised individuals

The triad can also be expanded with an additional two A terms:
- Authenticity
	- Ensures users can be identified and that input can be verified to originate from a trustworthy source
- Accountability
	- Ensures the actions of a person or account can be traced back to that person or account
