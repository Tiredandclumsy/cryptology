A key exchange algorithm is a method  by which two (or more) parties can communicate via a public channel, and end the process with a shared secret. This secret is usually then used as the key for a [[symmetric enciphering scheme]].

# Examples
One simple method of key exchange is [[Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange|Diffie-Hellman]].
