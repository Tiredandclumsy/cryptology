A blockcipher $E$ with block length $\ell$ is a [[symmetric enciphering scheme]] with $\mathcal M = \mathcal C = \{0,1\}^\ell$. 
Note that if $\mathcal E = (K_g, E, D)$ is a correct block cipher, then for any fixed $k \leftarrow K_g$ $E_k$ is a permutation on $\{0,1\}^\ell$, and $D$ is the inverse permutation.
