Cryptology is the study of encryption and decryption.
The study of encryption alone is known as Cryptography, and the study of decryption without knowledge of the encrypting details is called Cryptanalysis.

# Terminology
Cryptology has a set of key terminology:
- Plaintext: The original message to be encrypted
- Ciphertext: The coded message that must be decrypted to be read
- Enciphering or encryption: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext
- Deciphering or decryption: The process of restoring plaintext from the ciphertext
- [[cipher|Cipher]] or Cryptographic system: A specific encryption/decryption algorithm pair
